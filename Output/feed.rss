I’m always eager to learn new things and have attended code camps, read programming books, and participated in Meetup events. I even started my own Meetup group and co-hosted a podcast, both relating to iOS development and the Swift programming language.</description><link>https://jasonmitchell.io</link><language>en</language><lastBuildDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 07:50:27 -0700</lastBuildDate><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 07:50:27 -0700</pubDate><ttl>250</ttl><atom:link href="https://jasonmitchell.io/feed.rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jasonmitchell.io/blog/2022/first-post</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://jasonmitchell.io/blog/2022/first-post</link><pubDate>Mon, 9 May 2022 22:22:00 -0700</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://jasonmitchell.io/blog/2021/0304-hey-world</guid><title>HEY World</title><description>The first post I created.

Here’s my first attempt at writing a post with “HEY World” (but that’s not true, I tried before they made it publicly available 😂)...</p><p>I’m not sure I’ll actually write more posts using this, but I think it’s a great addition to HEY. Also love how it relates to “Hello, World!” - the first program everyone writes in a new programming language.</p><p>See you all later!.. well, I won’t actually see if you read this, but that’s part of the beauty. 😁</p><p>Jason</p><p>Update: Well, this blog <em>was</em> on HEY World... I've since moved to a blog that I fully control using John Sundell's "Publish" (as of May 2022).</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
