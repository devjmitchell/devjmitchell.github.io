# HEY World

HEY, World! Here’s my first attempt at writing a post with “HEY World” (but that’s not true, I tried before they made it publicly available 😂)...

I’m not sure I’ll actually write more posts using this, but I think it’s a great addition to HEY. Also love how it relates to “Hello, World!” - the first program everyone writes in a new programming language.

See you all later!.. well, I won’t actually see if you read this, but that’s part of the beauty. 😁

Update: Well, this blog *was* on HEY World... I've since moved to a blog that I fully control using John Sundell's "Publish" (as of May 2022).
