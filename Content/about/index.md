# About

I’m a U.S. Marine veteran that became a self-taught developer, starting in 2013. I’m always eager to learn new things and have attended code camps, read programming books, and participated in Meetup events. I even started my own Meetup group and co-hosted a podcast, both relating to iOS development and the Swift programming language.
