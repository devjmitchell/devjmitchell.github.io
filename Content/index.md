I've been working as an iOS developer since 2018 and I'm currently part of GoDaddy, contributing to the main iOs app. Go check it out in the App Store!

*Disclaimer: Opinions are my own (in case this isn't obvious)*

### Secret Project

I'm trying to find the time to work on a secret side project that I've been thinking about for years. I've started the app, but have yet to find enough "spare" time to continue on it.

More details if/when I make some progress on it!

### Just Hangman

A simple hangman game for your iPhone. You can choose short, medium, and long words to guess. Keeps track of your best win streaks.

See it in the App Store.. [Download]()

### Math 4 Kids

The App Store is already saturated with math apps, so I didn't put this app on the App Store. Instead, I made this as an example for my kids - to show them how to make a simple math quiz on iOS.

## On the Side
